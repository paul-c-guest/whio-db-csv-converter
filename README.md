## whio-db-csv-converter

The purpose of this application is to quickly create maintenance sheets for trapping areas, from CSV data exported from the whio database.

The source needs to be compiled. 

Usage is from the terminal - pass in the CSV file containing records of traps, exported from the whio database. An HTML file will be created in the same location as the CSV which can be easily opened in a browser for printing.

The HTML output will only contain traps which have maintenance status set appropriately -- operational traps will not appear.
